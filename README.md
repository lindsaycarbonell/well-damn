# well-damn
I've got lots of questions about N.C. dams (not wells, unfortunately) and I'm finding lots of answers.

## Research so far:

## Things you can expect from me about dams: 

- A blog post about how I called a gas station to see if a dam existed
- A blog post about how I'm determining the best ways to find the answer to life's burning question: "How likely is it that the dam(s) near me will affect my life?"
- Possibly a web app that crowdsources finding dams that have been breached (unless there's already a field for that in the database, which will make me embarassed but also, secretly, I will still want to make a Find Dams Near You adventure app)
- A...*sigh*...fact sheet about dams.
- And visuals!! When I find things that can be best told visually. Like on maps. Probably.
